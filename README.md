In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install --global yarn`

"npm install --global yarn" installs Yarn globally using npm. Yarn is a faster and more reliable package manager than npm, developed by Facebook, Google, and Tilde. After installation, the "yarn" command can be used to execute commands or scripts. Yarn offers benefits such as faster installations, better compatibility, and more predictable builds. However, it's not a drop-in replacement for npm, and some packages may not be compatible with it.
